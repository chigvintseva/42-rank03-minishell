## Description

**Minishell** is a simplified reimplementation of a Unix shell,inspired by **bash**.
The goal of this project is to deeply understand how shells work internally, including:

- process creation and management
- file descriptors and redirections
- environment variables
- signal handling
- parsing and command execution

This project recreates a minimal interactive shell that can interpret and execute user commands while respecting Unix behavior as closely as possible.

---

### Core functionality

- Interactive prompt using `readline`
- Command history
- Execution of binaries via:
  - absolute paths (`/bin/ls`)
  - relative paths (`./a.out`)
  - $PATH resolution

---

#### Pipes

- Supports chaining commands with `|`

Example:

	ls -l | grep .c | wc -l

---

#### Redirections

| **Operator** | **Description**    |
|--------------|--------------------|
| `<`          | `stdin` redirect   |
| `>`          | `stdout` overwrite |
| `>>`         | `stdout` append    |
| `<<`         | heredoc            |

Example:

	cat < input.txt > output.txt

---

#### Environment variables

- `$VAR` → expansion
- `$?` → last exit status

---

#### Quotes
- `'single quotes'` → no expansion
- `"double quotes"` → allows `$` expansion

---

#### Builtins

- `echo` (with `-n`)
- `cd`
- `pwd`
- `export`
- `unset`
- `env`
- `exit`

---

#### Signals

| **Key**    | **Behavior**    |
|------------|-----------------|
| `Ctrl+C`   | new prompt      |
| `Ctrl+D`   | exit shell      |
| `Ctrl+\`   | ignored         |

### Architecture

Minishell is divided into several logical components:

#### 1. Lexer (Tokenizer)

Splits input into tokens:

- commands
- arguments
- operators (`|`, `<`, `>` etc.)
- quote logic
- environment variables

#### 2. Parser

Builds a structured representation of commands:

- command nodes
- redirections
- pipelines

#### 3. Executor

Responsible for:

- `fork()`
- `execve()`
- `pipe()`
- `dup2()`

#### 4. Builtins

Executed without `execve()` when required (e.g. `cd`, `pwd`)

#### 5. Signal handling

- Uses `sigaction`
- Only one global variable allowed (stores signal number)

---

## Instructions

#### Compile

make

#### Run

./minishell
